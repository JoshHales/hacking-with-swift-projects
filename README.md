### This repo contains my project files from undertaking the hacking with swift course by Paul Hudson.

## The Projects

### WeSplit

* A bill splitting app. Enter the total cost of a bill, the amount of tip to leave & how many people you are with. The App will then calculate and display how much each person needs to pay.

### TempConvert

* A temperature conversion app. Enter an input unit & an output unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin) along with an input temperature value. The app will then calculate the converted output temperature value.

### GuessTheFlag

* A game in which the user is shown the name of a country along with three different flags. The aim is to match the country with the correct flag. Once 10 questions have been answered, the round ends and the user is shown their score out of 10, a new round can then be started.
