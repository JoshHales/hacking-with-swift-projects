### This repo contains my project files from undertaking the hacking with swift course by Paul Hudson.

## The Projects

### WeSplit

* A bill splitting app. Enter the total cost of a bill, the amount of tip to leave & how many people you are with. The App will then calculate and display how much each person needs to pay.

### TempConvert

* A temperature conversion app. Enter an input unit & an output unit (Celsius, Fahrenheit or Kelvin) along with an input temperature value. The app will then calculate the converted output temperature value.

### GuessTheFlag

* A game in which the user is shown the name of a country along with three different flags. The aim is to match the country with the correct flag. Once 10 questions have been answered, the round ends and the user is shown their score out of 10, a new round can then be started.

### RockPaperScissors

* A Rock Paper Scissors game with a twist. Each turn of the game the app will pick either Rock Paper or Scissors, along with prompting the player to win or to lose. The player must then tap the correct move to either win or lose the game. A correct answer adds 1 to the players score and an incorrect answer subtracts 1 from the score. The game ends after 10 questions at which point the players score is displayed.

### BetterRest

* An app to to help coffee drinkers get enough sleep. The app asks the user three questions:
	* When do you want to wake up?
	* Desired amount of sleep
	* Daily coffee intake
	
	Upon clicking the calculate button, the app feeds these values into a  ML algorithm and displays the users ideal bedtime.
